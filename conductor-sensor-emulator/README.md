# conductor-sensor-emulator

An embedded software project aiming to successfully emulate signals from Conductor Sensors such that data from the emulator is indistinguishable from true sources, with minimal to no required adjustments to enable its use across boards from differnt manufacturers (e.g., the three boards/DKs used in the BLE custom service projects in this repository, from Nordic, SiLabs, and STMicroelectronics).
